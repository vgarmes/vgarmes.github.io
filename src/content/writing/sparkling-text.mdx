Recently, I stumbled upon [Linear's stunning Readme page](https://linear.app/readme).
It's not just a "readme", it's a storytelling masterclass.
A nostalgic journey through the early magical days of the internet.
A reflection on how things changed and Linear's mission to revive that sense of wonder.

One detail that really caught my eye on this page was their use of
delightful text effects. Among them, this highlighted text that sparkles when you hover:

<Demo>
  <div class="flex h-[100px] items-center justify-center">
    <SparklingText client:load>A magical moment.</SparklingText>
  </div>
</Demo>
