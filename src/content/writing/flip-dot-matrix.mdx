The other day when I signed up to my workspace in Linear I noticed a nice loading component that consisted of an animated flip-dot matrix inspired by those vintage airport flight status displays. It looked something like this:

<Demo>
  <div class="flex items-center justify-center px-3 py-6">
    <FlipDotGridDemo client:load />
  </div>
</Demo>

I thought it was amazing, offering a lot of possibilities since it could essentially scale and display any pixel art you wanted.

After doing some research, I found out that the creator is Linear’s founding designer, Adrien Griveau, who shared it in this [X post](https://x.com/Griveau/status/1932832554354163804). He mentioned that it was inspired by vintage airport flight status displays—though the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it was the [Dreamcast VMU display](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE0SOqVSYK_).

Either way, I think it adds a great layer of retro aesthetics—the kind of detail I love to see in a web app.
