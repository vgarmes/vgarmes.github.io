Bonus for Node users
Once I tried to install the dependencies in one of my node projects, the following error popped up:
`node command not found`
To my surpise, it turns out that [`nvm` does not support Fish](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#fish). In fact, `nvm`isn't even in the path. In order to solve this I used one of the alternatives mentioned in `nvm` docs which is [Bass](https://github.com/edc/bass). Bass makes it possible to use bash utilities in fish shell by capturing what environment variables are modified by the utility of interest (in this case `nvm`), and replaying the changes in fish.

To install Bass with Fisher:
`fisher install edc/bass`

Then create the file `~/.config/fish/functions/nvm.fish` with the following function to be able to call `nvm`:

```fish
function nvm
  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv
end
```

Finally, you will need to switch to a specific node version (assuming you already have node installed). You can list all your installed versions with `nvm ls` and select one using `nvm use` as usual.
