When I started revamping my personal site I had very clear that I was going to use Astro. Astro is a framwork focused on performance and speed, which allows shipping sites with the minimum JavaScript and following a library-agnostic islands architecture.

However, if you want to add functionality that needs a backend, you don't have an all-in solution like you get with frameworks like Next.js.

So, when I needed to add the possibility to like posts, I had to find my own solution to build an api. One of my favorite platforms for doing this is Cloudflare.

With a very generous free tier, Cloudflare has a technology called Workers which allows you to quickly set up serverless endpoints instantly deployed across their 300 locations throughout the world using their Edge network.

Moreover, Cloudflare has a database called D1 (in open alpha by the time this was written).

## The tech stack

Since I wanted to take full advantage of Cloudflare's Edge network, I used technologies that work with its JavaScript runtime:

- Hono: backend framewor similar to Express but it runs on CDN Edges.
- Drizzle: ORM that supports Edge runtime
