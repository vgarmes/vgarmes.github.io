Animating tabs is a great example of how small details can make a UI feel more refined. They make interactions feel intentional and responsive.

For these tabs, I kept things simple: just CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I leaned on GPU-friendly properties like `transform` and `opacity` to keep the animations smooth and snappy.

First, there’s the underline that slides to the active tab. I used `translateX` and `scaleX` to move and resize it based on the target tab, which is a quick way to get that fluid motion without triggering layout.

Then I added a backdrop element to simulate a hover effect. It follows the mouse between tabs using `translateX`, adjusting its size dynamically by reading the hovered tab’s offset (`offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight`, etc) values on `mouseenter`.

Here’s what it looks like in action.
