import ScratchReveal from '~/components/demos/scratch-reveal.astro'

The other day I came across [dmytro’s portfolio](https://pqoqubbw.dev/), and one of his works caught my eye. It was a component that imitates scratch cards, where the user drags the mouse over the surface to reveal text underneath (in this example, an API key). I thought it was a playful detail you don’t usually see in apps.

So I decided to recreate it using a canvas element. The canvas starts with a background that looks like the silver surface of scratch cards, and as the user drags the mouse (or a finger on touch devices), the surface is erased to reveal the hidden text. You can check out the full code [here](https://github.com/vgarmes/vgarmes.github.io/blob/main/src/components/demos/scratch-reveal.astro) if you’re interested in the details.
