Over the last year I've been working on a team with no designers where I had to come up with my own interface.

I frequently referenced Vercel's design system. Every time I was building a component, I quickly went to their design system pages to check how they did it, how they animated it, etc.

Then I investigated a bit who was behind that work. I already knew that shadcn and jhey, people who I also reference for their incredible work, started working at Vercel. But then I discovered other people like Paco Coursey, Emil Kowalski and Rano.

I investigated a bit about them and I notice something I was really missing about web development, especially these last couple of years where building things has become so much easier with AI. They were not just building, they were crafting. Things with a lot of thought put into it that felt simple, unique and a delight to use. You can just sense the thoughtfulness and quality.
