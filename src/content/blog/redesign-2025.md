In 2021, I made a big shift career-wise. After working as an electrical engineer for about 8 years (ok, it took me some time), I realized that path wasn’t aligned with what I truly cared about. I wasn’t fulfilled. So I made a change—I became a web developer.

Since then, I have been developing different iterations of my personal site which reflected who I was at that point in time. Early versions were all about experimenting, pushing myself technically, and showing off what I could do so I could land a gig. 

Now it's been 4 years since I've been working as a frontend engineer. In 2024, I joined Sybo Games, and that experience had a big impact on how I think about designing web sites. I went from working in a team with dedicated designers in my previous job, to a smaller, more self-directed team where design decisions were up to me. I had to think more carefully about how things looked, how they worked, and why they mattered.

At the same time, I drew a lot of inspiration from the work being done by other design engineers, especially the team at Vercel, because they have managed to gather developers and designers like shadcn, Jhey Tompkins, Paco Coursey, and Runo, which I have admired for their work for a long time. Their approach, grounded in clarity and simplicity, helped me see that great interfaces don’t have to be complicated. In fact, the best ones often aren’t.

This latest version is a new reflection of my new focus when building sites: performance, simplicity, and craft.

I just want this space to reflect, write what I’m thinking about, and what I’m building.

No filler. 
 
No overengineering. 
 
Just me, showing up as I am.
